/// Implements a naÃ¯ve random-access array of bits with access to the underlying bytewise storage.
///
/// The capacity of the array is set at creation time and can not be changed afterwards. For all
/// intents and purposes, it is as close to a fixed-length array as Swift can manage.
///
/// This is used to interpret the MySQL binary result set wire protocol's "NULL bitmap", which is
/// a sequence of N bits (padded to the nearest byte with zeroes), with each bit flagging whether
/// the field at the same index as the bit in the data row is NULL (and thus has no value).
///
/// In theory, we could use the `BitArray` type from `swift-collections` for this, but as of
/// the time of this writing, the package still has not received a 1.1 release, before which the
/// bit collection types don't exist. Even if this weren't the case, however, we might stick to
/// this version anyway, as the as-yet unreleased `BitArray` implementation in `swift-collections`
/// is a dynamically-sized collection, which implies a certain amount of overhead the logic
/// in use here simply does not need.
